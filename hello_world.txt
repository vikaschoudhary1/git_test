Hello, this is vikas. 
This is a new message, just for the sake of editing the doc. 
This is my third or fourth day using git on my laptop.
I am very grateful that I have been able to take advantage of The Odin Project and learn about so many tools
in such a short length of time. 
Thank you Odin Project and every person behind it.
